# cacheSimulator
Computer Architecture Project for Section 001. Teammates include Hunter Hoch, Jamie Gallegos and Rene Guardiola

This project used Github as a source for uploading project updates.

FOR TESTING, use the NEW (as of Milestone 1) following line to start the program:
Sim.exe -f Trace1.trc -f trace2.trc -f trace3.trc -s 512 -b 16 -a 8 -r RR -p 1024

Notice the first trace file is called "Trace1.trc". This is very important.
This line also now uses "Sim.exe" instead of what used to be "Sim"
